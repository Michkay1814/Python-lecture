Python Exercise

1.# Create a variable called `count` and set it to 10.
2.# Use the `+=` assignment operator to add 5 to the `count` variable.
3. #Print the value of `count` to the console.
4.# Use the `-=` assignment operator to subtract 3 from the `count` variable.
5.# Print the value of `count` to the console.
6.# Use the `*=` assignment operator to multiply the `count` variable by 2.
7.# Print the value of `count` to the console.

count=10
count +-5
#Propose a program to calculate Simple Interest

# Simple Interest = (P x T x R)/100 Where, P is the principal amount T is the time and R is the rate

# Take P, T and R as user inputs.
# get the principal amount from the user and print it
p =float(input('enter the principal amount: '))
print('principal =' p, '/n')

# get the time from the user and print it
T= float(input('enter the time: '))
print('Time =' T, '/N')

# Get the rate from the user and print it
R=float(input('enter the rate: '))
print('Rate ='R, '/n')

# Calculate the simple interest and print it
simple_interest =(P*T*R)/100
print('The Simple Interestis:', simple_interest)
